This was a quick experiment with Animations. I had analyzed the Keeling Curve data set in my PHYS 381
final about a month ago. Came across a radial plot of the C02 concentrations, and figured it would be
interested to use the data I already had to create an animation (first attempt at animation in python).

It's quite basic but a good learn experience.
